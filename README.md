# Office_app
This app is inspired from the TV show "The Office". It uses Flask on the server side and JavaScript and HTML on the front end. It allows the user to do 2 things-
1) log sales 
2) create a Party Planning Committee

The log sales part has the features to delete and create sales and the party-planning committee has drag and drop functionality. 
Both these webpages save data on the server so that the changes are saved and can be viewed on different devices connected to the same server.
